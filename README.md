# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

## Description

I created this work scheduler for the DU coding boot camp. This scheduler is made to keep up with tasks throughout the day in an easy way. The color of the hour is done so that past hours are grey, the current red, and future green. You can input tasks into any hour and save the task into local storage with the save button next to each hour.

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
